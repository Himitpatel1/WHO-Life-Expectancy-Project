# WHO Life Expectancy Project  
**Predictive Analytics in Global Health (CIND820 Project)**  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
This project was completed for the **CIND820 – Capstone Project** course at **Toronto Metropolitan University**, under the supervision of **Dr. Ceni Babaoglu**.  

The goal of the project is to study global health and socioeconomic factors that influence **life expectancy** across countries.  
The dataset comes from the **World Health Organization (WHO)** and covers the years **2000–2015**.  

It includes variables such as GDP, Schooling, BMI, Alcohol consumption, Adult Mortality, and other health indicators.  
Each record represents one **country–year** observation, and the target variable is **Life expectancy (years)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore global patterns and trends in life expectancy.  
- Handle missing values and prepare the dataset for analysis.  
- Build a **Linear Regression** model to predict life expectancy.  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MAE and R².

---

## 🧰 Methods and Tools  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib  
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Regression Modeling

## 🧩 How to Reproduce  

1. Open the notebook (`.ipynb`) in **Google Colab**.  
2. Upload the `Life_Expectancy_Data.csv` file when prompted.  
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.  
4. Review the summary statistics, charts, and model outputs.

## 📊 Model Summary  

A **Linear Regression model** was trained using six predictors:  
`GDP`, `Schooling`, `BMI`, `Alcohol`, `Adult Mortality`, and `Infant deaths`.  

**Performance Results:**  
- Mean Absolute Error ≈ 5 years  
- R² Score ≈ 0.75  

These results show that education, economic factors, and mortality rates have a strong relationship with life expectancy.
