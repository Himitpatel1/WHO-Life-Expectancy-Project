# WHO Life Expectancy Project  
**Predictive Analytics in Global Health: Modeling Life Expectancy (CIND820 Project)**  

# Overview
This project is part of the Toronto Metropolitan University course **CIND820 – Capstone Project**.  
The goal is to analyze global health and socioeconomic data to predict **life expectancy** across countries using machine learning and regression models.  

The dataset is obtained from the **World Health Organization (WHO)** and covers the years **2000–2015**.  
It includes variables such as life expectancy, GDP, schooling, healthcare expenditure, immunization rates, and more.

# Objectives  
- Identify the main factors influencing life expectancy worldwide.  
- Compare results between low-income and high-income countries.  
- Build regression and machine learning models to predict life expectancy.  
- Evaluate model performance using R² and RMSE metrics.  

# Methods and Tools  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib  
- **Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, Random Forests  

# Workflow  
1. Data Collection (WHO Dataset)  
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Model Development (Regression + Machine Learning)  
5. Model Evaluation  
6. Visualization and Interpretation of Results  

# Dataset  
**Source:** [WHO Life Expectancy Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)  
**Coverage:** 193 countries, years 2000–2015
